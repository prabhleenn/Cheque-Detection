<h1>📁 Cheque Detection using Yolov8 </h1>

<br>
🔍 In this project, I've implemented cheque detection using the YOLOv8 model. To train and evaluate the model, I have created a custom dataset consisting of 216 images of cheques, which have been manually annotated and labeled by myself using the Roboflow platform. The dataset is divided into three subsets as follows:<br>
<br>1) Training Set: 182 images
<br>2) Validation Set: 23 images
<br>3) Test Set: 11 images
