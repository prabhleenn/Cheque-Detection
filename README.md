# üìÅ Cheque Detection using YOLOv8

In this project, I've implemented cheque detection using the YOLOv8 model. To train and evaluate the model, I have created a custom dataset consisting of 216 images of cheques, which have been manually annotated and labeled by myself using the Roboflow platform. The dataset is divided into three subsets as follows:
1. **Training Set**: 182 images
2. **Validation Set**: 23 images
3. **Test Set**: 11 images

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to detect the authenticity of cheques in images using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The project includes:
- A custom dataset of cheque images.
- Pre-trained YOLOv8 models.
- Scripts for running inference on new images and videos.
- Scripts for training the model on the custom dataset.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.7+ and `pip` installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/prabhleenn/cheque-detection-yolov8.git
    cd cheque-detection-yolov8
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
### Running Inference
To run inference on images or videos using the pre-trained model, use the following commands:

- On an image:
    ```sh
    python detect.py --source path/to/your/image.jpg --weights path/to/yolov8/weights.pt
    ```

### Training üîç
To train the model on the custom cheque dataset, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your dataset is in the YOLO format (see [Dataset Format](#dataset-format) below).
2. Update the configuration file with your dataset paths and parameters.
3. Run the training script:
    ```sh
    python train.py --data path/to/your/data.yaml --cfg path/to/yolov8/config.yaml --weights path/to/yolov8/weights.pt
    ```

## Dataset Format
The dataset is organized in the following directory structure, with annotations in YOLO format:
